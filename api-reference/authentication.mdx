Oatmeal service uses API keys to authenticate requests. These API keys can be generated within the dashboard and must be supplied with each request.

```bash
'Authorization': 'Bearer <api_key>'
```

Currently, oatmeal service doesn't support scope limited API keys, so every API key has full access to all endpoints and data.

Please remember to:

- Keep your keys in a safe location
- Avoid leaving them in publicly-accessible location (e.g. frontend of your app)
- Rotate your API keys regularly. Doing so helps to ensure the security of your data and prevent unauthorized access.
